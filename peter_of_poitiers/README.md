Currently should contain xml files of group working on Peter of Poitiers' Compendium Historiae

This TEI-XML file provides a semi-diplomatic transcription of the ten prophecies of Daniel included in the Compendium Historiae in Genealogia Christi. The source material is drawn from the manuscript Klosterneuburg, Augustiner-Chorherrenstift, Cod. 696 (K), f. 5v.
In this transcription, I have systematically signaled the expansion of abbreviations and maintained the original sequence of the rubrics marking the visions, even in instances where they are physically misaligned with their corresponding text paragraphs.
Currently, I am transcribing a second, more elaborate witness of the Compendium. As is typical for later traditions of this work, the original narrative in this version is expanded with exegetical commentaries and allegorical interpretations. My ultimate goal is to perform a comparative analysis of the two transcriptions to provide an immediate, visual representation of the textual evolution, highlighting the interpolations introduced over time.
